The increasing volume of data from user interaction to Internet-based applications requires new storage and processing technologies. Typical databases can not process large datasets of terabytes in reasonable time. MapReduce is a programming paradigm that was invented by Yahoo! to process large datasets in key/value pattern.  Hadoop is an open source implementation of MapReduce, that is used to store and process large datasets in parallel and distributed manner on cluster of commodity computers. Since preparing and maintenance of infrastructure for storage and process of large datasets requires infrastructure, storage and computational resources, which costs expensive to organizations. As solution, organizations can use cloud computing services, to store, retrieve and process large datasets and use provided resources according to their need.\\

Running large clusters of Hadoop on cloud infrastructure is expensive for organizations. The optimization added to Hadoop schedulers provides the opportunity of multi-tenancy for the organization, where sing Hadoop cluster can be shared by multiple organization. Cloud operators such as AMAZON EC2, provides virtualized infrastructure, where virtual machines are collocated on single physical machine. This thesis is about analysis of side effects of collocated VMs ( Collocated VMs are datanodes of Hadoop cluster(s)) on performance of Hadoop. The thesis also evaluates the optimizations made to Hadoop schedulers. More precisely, the performance of fairshare scheduler and capacity share schedulers are analysed. The effect of speculative task execution for mentioned schedulers is also explained. \\

As result, we want to show that speculative task execution for small jobs does not improve the performance of Hadoop performance. In one hand, the evaluation shows that performance of capacity share scheduler is better than fairshare scheduler. On the other hand, capacity share scheduler has worst fairness for job completion time in comparison to fairshare scheduler. We also proof that for all the schedulers the collocation of datanodes VMs from same cluster has better performance results in comparison to collocation of VMs from different clusters. The experiment results show, though collocation of datanodes has negative impact by increasing job completion time for both capacity share and fairshare schedulers of Hadoop, but capacity share scheduler is more robust to collocation of datanodes.
