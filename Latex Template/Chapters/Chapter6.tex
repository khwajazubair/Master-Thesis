%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Afghanistan is land lock country which most parts are enclosed by mountains.  Large  number of Afghan people scattered in and out of Afghanistan during last 3 decades of war.  This made the Information Technology and Communication(ICT) services and facilities an essential issue for Afghanistan’s immediate reconstruction. After the Temporary Government in 2001 established in Afghanistan, the country obtained new view of political and socio-economic rehabilitation and structure. 

\section{Analysis of IT‌ Infrastructure in Afghanistan}
In the last 2 decades (80s and 90s), socio-political upheavals and war not only destroyed Afghanistan’s infrastructures and wealth, but it also destroyed the ICT  system. By establishment of the new government after 2011, Afghan government started to encourage the private sector to do investment in Afghanistan's ICT projects. Parallel to the investment of private sectors on ICT field  the government also started to develop ICT infrastructure and services in Afghanistan. As result of encourages big investors like AWCC, Roshan, MTN and Etisalat entered to ICT market of Afghanistan. In order to develop ICT and to fulfil the human resource requirements of the ICT field in Afghanistan the Afghan government Established Computer Science Faculties in many universities of Afghanistan, ICTI institute , creation of ICT Law and ICT strategy plan. Almost 80 percent of Afghan people have access to telecommunication that indicates rapid growth of ICT and implementation of ICT projects. In this section our focus is more on national projects which are offered or going to be offered by Afghan government.\cite{afg1}\\

Afghan people need to strengthen and diversify their economies, educate and engage their young people, develop the infrastructures that support economic growth, and lure back the educated professionals and business-people who have fled to other countries. ICT will be instrumental in meeting these challenges, but recent history shows that Afghanistan is suspicious of, and resistant to, technological change. Based on a report by the United Nations Science and Technology Group for Development (UNSTD), ICT strategies are often developed and publicized mainly to attract external investment to construct new infrastructures or to market hardware and software without giving sufficient attention to local concerns and requirements \cite{afg2}.\\


\subsection{National Optical Fiber Backbone}
This project will install a national backbone network across the country, which will support all the other projects (digital lines, microwave, etc). It will allow a high volume of national and international traffic and will connect major provinces and to neighbouring countries. This Network will link many of the principle cities of Afghanistan following the route of the national roadway system. This project is for the turnkey construction and operation of the complete Optical Fiber Communication (OFC) ring around Afghanistan which is estimated approximately 3.200 km length. In addition to linking many of the key cities. This project also calls for the construction of accesses to the backbone for the other cities and provinces not directly on the backbone route. Those access routes for the other cities and provinces will be taken up separately. There will be other major spurs off this main loop connecting to neighbouring countries Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.\cite{afg1} 	

\subsection{Challenges}
Although, Afghan ICT had good progress in past years, but still there are challenges that needs time to be solved. Low levels of education and literacy, poor technology infrastructures,lack of ICT skilled human resources, lack of political interest to ICT and a wide gap between the disposable income of the relatively few have more and more have less income can be counted as number of challenges . Security is a big challenge that not only ICT project implementation but over all Afghan government suffer from.  Use of the Internet requires a fairly complex set of skills and technology. At very least, one must have electricity, a communications line, a terminal capable of interacting across the communications lines, and (in most cases) a reasonable fluency in English \cite{afg3}. Cultural issues may be  important in determining the use of the ICT in Afghanistan. 


\subsection{Cloud Computing In Afghanistan}

For the companies invested in IT market of Afghanistan, poor technology infrastructure, lack of security , required energy resources, IT experts all these challenges makes it difficult to establish and  maintain large data centres of their own for storage and process of the data. As solution, these organizations may rely on cloud services where all the infrastructure, resources, storage, process and maintenance is provided by cloud operator to the client via an Internet connection. The organization only need Internet connection with high enough speed to access the cloud services/infrastructure and use it according to their need. Using cloud services, the organizations are free of headache for maintenance, physical resources, security, maintenance and hiring experts to manage IT resources.
